# Electrical Engineer

## Education
- B.S., Electrical Engineering w/ Math minor | Purdue University West Lafayette (_Expected May 2025_)

## Work Experience
**Undergraduate Research Assistant for Quantum Integrated Photonics Lab (QUIP) (_January - August 2023_)
- Design and tested various optical filters such as a double ring resonator that act as single photon sources for quantum information experiments
- Performed simulations to find optimal dimensions of waveguide using finite difference eigenmode solver for optical waveguides using Ansys Lumerical CAD software
- Presented our research of optical waveguides at Purdueâ€™s spring Research Fair to graduate students in the field of silicon photonics

## Projects
### Bike Traffic Dataset Analysis (_Spring 2023_)
[Bike Traffic Proiject](https://github.com/graha229/Bike-Traffic-Problem)
Used **Python** to analyze and justify a correlation between daily bicyle patterns and weather conditions dataset. Our report justifiying our analysis includes using correlation analysis, linear regression, and K-Nearest_Neighbor to draw comparisons between variables.
