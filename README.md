# Electrical Engineer

## Education
- B.S., Electrical Engineering w/ Math minor | Purdue University West Lafayette (_Expected May 2025_)

## Work Experience
**Undergraduate Research Assistant for Quantum Integrated Photonics Lab (QUIP) (_January - August 2023_)
- Design and test various photonic compoenents commonly used in silicon photonics by studying the relationship between power injected into the waveguide and heat dissipated.
- Performed simulations to find optimal dimensions of waveguide using finite difference eigenmode solver for optical waveguides using Ansys Lumerical CAD software
- Presented our research of optical waveguides at Purdueâ€™s spring Research Fair to graduate students in the field of silicon photonics

## Projects
### B-tree Search, Insert, and Delete Operations (_Fall 2023_)
[B-tree Operations](https://github.com/graha229/B-tree-Operations)
Creates and manipulates a data structure known as a B-tree by performing operations such as instertion and delting nodes from the tree.

### OLED Configuration STM32 Microcontroller Project  (_Fall 2023_)
[STM32 OLED Game](https://github.com/graha229/STM32-OLED-Game)
Project introduces the the Direct Memory Access (DMA) and Serial Periphal Interface (SPI) to display messages and play a simple game OLED LCD display using a 4x4 keypad for the controls.

### Bike Traffic Dataset Analysis (_Spring 2023_)
[Bike Traffic Project](https://github.com/graha229/Bike-Traffic-Problem)
Used **Python** to analyze and justify a correlation between daily bicyle patterns and weather conditions dataset. Our report justifiying our analysis includes using correlation analysis, linear regression, and K-Nearest_Neighbor to draw comparisons between variables.

### Huffman Algorithm in C (_Fall 2022_)
[Huffman Algorithm](https://github.com/graha229/Huffman-Algorithm)
Utilizes data structures such as linked list and binary serarch tree to perform Huffman's data compression technique in a C program. Implemented following code quality standards and a test-driven development approach.
